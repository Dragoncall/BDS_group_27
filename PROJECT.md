# Person Sentiment Analysis
## Project Big Data Science | Group 27

This project aims to search the sentiment of a couple of optimised prominent people based on what people are tweeting about them.
This over time ranges as given by the user and with extra possible queries, such as count,
relevancy_type, geocode, ...

The twitter API is mirrored as closely as possible to allow easy entry for people with previous experience.
This project can thus be seen as an augmentation of the twitter API with sentiment analysis.

## Optimised handles
Some prominent figures were focused on by our team for analysis. These people contain extra tags and keywords used
a lot to depict them or reference them. We accept augmentations to these people. This can be done by adding or changing
keywords in the `prominent_people.json` file on our github.  

Optimised prominent people include:

- None currently (TODO: add these and include a link to their endpoint (which will be their handle most likely))
